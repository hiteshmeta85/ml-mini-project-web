### Classification of Disaster related Tweets from Social Media

At the time of a disaster, many people ask for help through social media. They make tweets on Twitter asking for
immediate rescue. Extraction of raw data from social media like Twitter based on a few parameters like disaster type,
location, and disaster-related hashtags. The tweets extracted have noise - unwanted data which needs to be filtered out.
Our models would classify disaster-related tweets. These classified tweets can then be used to identify those people who
need help and using this information higher authorities can take quick actions.
